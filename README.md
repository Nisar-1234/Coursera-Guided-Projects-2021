## [4.Avoid Overfitting Using Regularization in TensorFlow](https://github.com/ashishpatel26/Coursera-Guided-Projects-2021/tree/main/Avoid%20Overfitting%20Using%20Regularization%20in%20TensorFlow)

---

In this project, you will learn the basics of using weight regularization and dropout regularization to reduce over-fitting in an image classification problem. By the end of this project, you will have created, trained, and evaluated a Neural Network model that, after the training and regularization, will predict image classes of input examples with similar accuracy for both training and validation sets.

When we train neural network models, you may notice the model performing significantly better on training data as compared to data that it has not seen before, or not trained on before. This means that while we expect the model to learn the underlying patterns from a given data-set, often the model will also memorize the training examples. It will learn to recognize patterns which may be anomalous or may learn the peculiarities in the data-set. This phenomenon is called over-fitting and it's a problem because a model which is over-fit to the training data will not be able to generalize well to the data that it has not seen before and that sort of defeats the whole point of making the model learn anything at all. We want models which are able to give us predictions as accurately on new data as they can for the training data.

- Develop an understanding on how to avoid over-fitting with weight regularization and dropout regularization
- Be able to apply both weight regularization and dropout regularization in Keras with TensorFlow backend

**Regularization**

One of the reasons for **over-fitting** is that some of these parameter values can become somewhat large and therefore become too influential on the linear outputs of various hidden units and subsequently become too influential on the non-linear outputs from the activation functions as well. And it can be observed that by regularizing the weights in a way that their values don't become too large, we can reduce the over-fitting. In dropouts, by randomly removing certain nodes in a model, we are forcing the model to NOT assign large values to any particular weights - we are simply forcing the model to NOT rely on any particular weight too much. So, the result is, much like the weight normalization, that the values for weights will be regularized and will not become too large thereby reducing over-fitting.

**Results**

Now that your training is now complete, you should be able to see the training accuracy and the validation accuracy. The training accuracy keeps increasing as we train for more epochs and reaches a value that is consistently much higher than the validation accuracy. This is a clear case of over-fitting. The over-fitting problem is solved by using two regularization techniques.

## [6.Facial Expression Recognition with Keras](https://github.com/ashishpatel26/Coursera-Guided-Projects-2021/tree/main/Facial%20Recognition%20with%20Keras)

---

In this project, you will build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) in Keras from scratch to recognize facial expressions. The data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. The objective is to classify each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression into one of seven categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral). You will use OpenCV to automatically detect faces in images and draw bounding boxes around them. Once you have trained, saved, and exported the CNN, you will directly serve the trained model to a web interface and perform real-time facial expression recognition on video and image data. 

**Learning Objectives**

- Develop a facial expression recognition model in Keras
- Build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN)
- Deploy the trained model to a web interface with Flask
- Apply the model to real-time video streams and image data

---

In this project, you will build and train a multilayer perceptronl (MLP) model using Keras, with Tensorflow as its backend. We will be working with the Reuters dataset, a set of short newswires and their topics, published by Reuters in 1986. It's a very simple, widely used toy dataset for text classification. There are 46 different topics, some of which are more represented than others. But each topic has at least 10 examples in the training set. So in this project, you will build a MLP feed-forward neural network to classify Reuters newswires into 46 different mutually-exclusive topics.

---

Implement DCGAN or Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network, and you will train the network to generate realistic looking synthesized images. The term Deepfake is typically associated with synthetic data generated by Neural Networks which is similar to real-world, observed data - often with synthesized images, videos or audio. Through this hands-on project, we will go through the details of how such a network is structured, trained, and will ultimately generate synthetic images similar to hand-written digit 0 from the MNIST dataset.

## [13.Dimensionality Reduction using an Autoencoder](https://github.com/ashishpatel26/Coursera-Guided-Projects-2021/tree/main/Dimensionality%20Reduction%20using%20an%20Autoencoder)

---

In this project, you will learn how to generate your own high-dimensional dummy dataset. You will then learn how to preprocess it effectively before training a baseline PCA model. You will learn the theory behind the autoencoder, and how to train one in scikit-learn. You will also learn how to extract the encoder portion of it to reduce dimensionality of your input data. In the course of this project, you will also be exposed to some basic clustering strength metrics.

Use a ResNet-18 model and train it on a COVID-19 Radiography dataset. This dataset has nearly 3000 Chest X-Ray scans which are categorized in three classes - Normal, Viral Pneumonia and COVID-19. Our objective in this tutorial is to create an image classification model that can predict Chest X-Ray scans that belong to one of the three classes with a reasonably high accuracy.

 In this project, you’re going to learn what an autoencoder is, use Keras with Tensorflow as its backend to train your own autoencoder, and use this deep learning powered autoencoder to significantly enhance the quality of images. That is, our neural network will create high-resolution images from low-res source images.
